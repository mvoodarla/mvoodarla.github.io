This thought mainly has to do with how so many people think they're the shit (i.e. [Donald Trump][stephen]). So many people of power and politicians only see almost exclusively in the present or maybe a few years out because that's what their job is. They also believe that all the decision they make are the right ones or the ones that "matter". However, I think that when we start colonizing planets at a rate where we're finding some place new almost every year or something, people will come to realize how little that matters. Owning some arbitrary piece of land somewhere as a country or having partisan motives which screws with peoples' lives is just wack in my opinion. Even the idea of a country and the idea of being a "proud American" are just bullshit. People really have to start thinking bigger than that because so many others lose their lives or their loved ones because there are a few people at the top want to prove that they're better or are simply just stubborn. The reason I bring up colonizing other planets when talking about this is because I think it's one of many things that will bring these people into a proper perspective of how little they should matter in the lives of everyone else.
