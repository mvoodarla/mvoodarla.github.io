I don't know if I've ever truly found any of my classes ever to be interesting. They introduce me to certain ideas that I may find interesting or certain schools of thought that I wish to either employ or disagree with but I don't think classes themselves have ever been like "woah" to me. So when someone says that a class is interesting, I don't really know what to think. Kind of a random thought but true, as I'm studying for a midterm this upcoming week for a class that teaches cool concepts I guess but isn't a cool class.
