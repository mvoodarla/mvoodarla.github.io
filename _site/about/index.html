<p>Hi! I’m Mokshith, welcome to my blog. I just write a bunch of random things that come to my head here once a week. You can check out my short, sweet personal website at <a href="https://mokshith.xyz/">mokshith.xyz</a>. Below are just some random statements I’ve encountered over a period of time that I think are cool.</p>
