    <h2>Why is orange chicken so good?</h2>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pandaexpress.com/menu/entrees/orange-chicken">Panda Express Orange Chicken</a> (yes I capitolized every word there on purpose) is my favorite food. I've eaten it so many times these past few years in so many different mental (mad, sad, happy, grinding, lazy, etc) and physical settings (home, roof on top of home, backyard, couch, bed, car). Though I can't name all the different times I've had it, I know I've had it enough to give you a full on review. I think it comes down to a few factors: diverse flavor, awesome look, and nice texture. To start, the fact that this chicken is both sweet and has a little ting to it is awesome. It barely resembles what an orange tastes like but variety of taste receptors it fires when I eat it is mind blowing. It's sweet so you feel like you're eating a snack but it's also somewhat soy-saucey and not sour but something else which makes it unique to any other type of food I've had. Don't get me wrong, I've tasted many different sweet-ish chickens but none of them match the flavor like this does. The next factor is the awesome look. For one, I think the orange color of the chicken is one of the best shades of orange out there. My favorite color is this army color but a little darker type green but this orange comes in a close second. There's something fierce about it like a tiger or something if you know what I mean, makes you feel like a boss. It also shines really nicely in any type of lighting. I try to not eat this chicken in darker settings just because of the way light reflects off of this chicken. I think it simply elevates the eating experience. Finally, comes the texture. You CANNOT eat this chicken if the outside is not crunchy (trust me I've tried making it myself and it does not match). The fact that the outside is sort of crunchy and then the inside is not as much is literally the most perfect combination to the point at which I don't think I can eat it any other way. That said, I don't think every chicken can be eaten this way but for some reason a combination of the flavor, the look, and everything else requires this texture that's just really dope. Overall, yeah I think that's why there is no other food that can compare.

    <h2>What's after Life 3.0?</h2>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark">Max Tegmark</a> has an awesome book all of you should called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0">Life 3.0</a>. It's based around this idea that there are a total of 3 significant evolutions of how life can exist in our universe. This started off with the first ever life forms which could perform some action programmed within them but couldn't do much other than that. Comparing such a life to now, they have no free will, not even an illision of it, and live literally because they are programmed to live (it can be argued that even now we don't really have free will in many aspects but we won't get into that). Due to this limitation in their "software", there's nothing much they can change about their "software" or their "hardware". Then comes Life 2.0 which is where we're at now. We can argue that we have the ability to program ourselves through things such as motives and desires. I won't get into the illusion of free will or higher beings or anything like that but comparing ourselves to life before, we are able to "do what we want to". This means that we can change our "software". Then comes Life 3.0 which has the ability to change its software and hardware. Right now as human being, even if we look at prosthetics and what-not, everything is always being controlled by our own brain. If we don't have a brain, we can't do anything. However, the idea of Life 3.0 is that it can rewire itself in anyway it wants and has the freedom of completely modifying its own software or hardware based on its current needs, desires, and physical limitations. One could argue that the computer is the basis of this, all the way to artificial neural network these days (though they're nothing compared to our brains). I think so much of AI research right now is way too over-hyped but that's for another one of these posts. It's cool to think though how fast we've been able to iterate on our technology which is now able to perform some non-trivial functions of human beings in identifying objects, maneuvering arms, etc. Though it needs to develop much more to get to Life 3.0 where it has its own desires and can truly live in almost anything, it's cool to think that that's what we're working toward. However, I think this begs the question of what happens after that. Imagine a world where there is intelligent life in the form of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a> which can modify its own software or hardware. It still seems inconsequential in the sense that all it keeps doing is live on as we do but without a requirement of dying at some point or having to really feel any of the "pain" in life. At least, that's the human perspective. I think we're limited by our attachments to the herd of society, our families, and various receptors in our brain which force us to feel good or bad when certain things do or don't happen. Because AGI doesn't really have these limitations and doesn't really have to worry about "dying" at any point I think its perspective will be different and it will be able to solve "this" whatever "this" is. I guess I don't think we as humanity can really comprehend "this".

    <h2>Benefits of the Hive Mind</h2>
    <p>
        There's so many different Hollywood depictions of what the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_mind">Hive Mind</a> could achieve (for example, in one of the seasons of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.">Agents of Shield</a>) but I feel that those are all one sided. While I don't believe the hive mind is good, I want to highlight some of its benefits. This starts with talking about the inefficiencies of humanity, one of the biggest being making unified decisions. Everyone has their own opinion and their own reason as to why that opinion is fact. While one can argue that this brings diverse thought into conversation and allows for everyone to voice their opinion, it doesn't most effectively advance the human race as a species (which is presumably what the hive mind aims to do most effectively). While the hive mind won't always make decision that each of us always think are correct, its decisions will always follow the same pattern of thought that doesn't change over time. This allows for consistency in goals and consistency in properly acheiving any one of those goals. While I could highlight other benefits, I think this is the main one. That being said, this takes away from what we as humans believe to be the value in life (family, love, experience, etc). The hive mind simply has different unified utilitarian goals which allows it "to do so much more" than what we can do right now as an overall species. However, that is not what we value which is why it doesn't matter.

    <h2>How the world will change when we colonize other planets</h2>
    <p>
        This thought mainly has to do with how so many people think they're the shit (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQLS0UiLOgA&ab_channel=TheLateShowwithStephenColbert">Donald Trump</a>). So many people of power and politicians only see almost exclusively in the present or maybe a few years out because that's what their job is. They also believe that all the decision they make are the right ones or the ones that "matter". However, I think that when we start colonizing planets at a rate where we're finding some place new almost every year or something, people will come to realize how little that matters. Owning some arbitrary piece of land somewhere as a country or having partisan motives which screws with peoples' lives is just wack in my opinion. Even the idea of a country and the idea of being a "proud American" are just bullshit. People really have to start thinking bigger than that because so many others lose their lives or their loved ones because there are a few people at the top want to prove that they're better or are simply just stubborn. The reason I bring up colonizing other planets when talking about this is because I think it's one of many things that will bring these people into a proper perspective of how little they should matter in the lives of everyone else.
